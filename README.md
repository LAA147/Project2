# Kinetic modeling of acedogenic fermentation in a batch reactor

Acidogenic fermentation is a technology that is used to produce hydrogen and volatile fatty acids in friendly environmental way. The acidogenic fermentation is the initial phase of the anaerobic digestion of organic compounds to methane and carbon dioxide (i.e., biogas): soluble organic compounds are fermented into organic acids, such as acetic, propionic, butyric, and lactic acid, and other fermentation products, such as alcohols and hydrogen.

In the research article, "Kinetic model and study of the influence of pH, temperature and undissociated acids on acidogenic fermentation", the experimental results were validated with the predicted kinetic model results by varying the pH and temperature.
